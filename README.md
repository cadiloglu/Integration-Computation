# Integration-Computation
This console application expects upper bound and lower bound of integral as well as interval count. My module calculates the integration by three methods listed in the pdf file. Furthermore, my program keeps on working until the user inputs "0" character.
My fundamental functions are f(x)=e^(x^2) and f(x)=2e^x-2x
More details are at "Homework Document.pdf"'s 1st part.
